# About me ðŸ‘‹
**Ile-b/Ile-b** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on testing case scenerios on azure devops
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently excited to try new tools and technologies, helping improve them through thorough testing and detailed feedback.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects by helping test and optimize features, providing feedback, and ensuring products meet user expectations. 
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if you need help with testing, data analysis, or feature feedback!
- âš¡ Fun fact:  I enjoy visualizing and analyzing datasets to uncover insights that drive decision-making
